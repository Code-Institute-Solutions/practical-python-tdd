This repo contains the solution code for the *Test Driven Development with Python* lesson

## What is covered
In this lesson we'll see how we can make assertions in your code so we can assert that certain things work, or don't work. This will allow us to create expectations on how certain pieces of code should behave.

We'll use these assertions to build up a set of functions that will allow us to automate the testing of our code, and we'll look at different ways of testing code, too - i.e. writing tests after the code has been written, writing tests before the code is written, and also how to incrementally build up tests, while building a specific piece of functionality using a philosophy called **Test-Driven Development**.

We'll use these techniques used throughout this lesson to build a vending machine's change functionality.
